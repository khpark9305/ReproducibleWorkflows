A recent analysis of publicly released data accompanying published papers in Cognition showed that not all published numbers could be reproduced, even though the data and code were available (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.180448). The authors state that: "...suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings." In this workshop, I will suggest one way to minimize the chances of producing irreproducible results, focusing on repeated measures 2x2 factorial designs as a case study.

The steps I will discuss are:

- Experiment design, and planning sample size using simulated data

- Defining the analysis plan using simulated data

- Checking that your experiment software actually collects the data you need

- Once data are collected, visualizing and summarizing the data

- Creating an R package to document and release your data and analyses

- Code refactoring

- Integrating the data analysis into the manuscript

- Releasing data and code: a suggested checklist
